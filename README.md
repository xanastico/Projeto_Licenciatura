Final Degree Project 🚀:

2D game created in Unity to treat amblyopia in children in early childhood 👶🏼.
The game uses 3D glasses (blue and red lenses) 👓.

The game is currently being tested in three Portuguese hospitals.


To run, just open the Unity Hub, open the project and run. It's as simple as that 😁
